## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework - CAF

* The AWS CAF helps organizations develop
efficient and effective plans for their cloud
adoption journey.
* The AWS CAF breaks down the complex process
of planning a move to the cloud into manageable
pieces called perspectives.
* Perspectives consist of sets of business or
technology capabilities that are the responsibility
of key stakeholders.
* The AWS CAF provides a structure for
business and IT teams to work together to
adopt the cloud successfully.

## AWS Well Architected Framework

* The Well-Architected Framework provides a
consistent approach to evaluate cloud
architectures and guidance to help implement
designs.
* The Well-Architected Framework documents a
set of foundational questions that you can
use to understand whether a specific architecture
aligns well with cloud best practices.
* The Well-Architected Framework is organized into
pillars: **operational excellence**, `security`,
`reliability`, `performance efficiency`, `cost
optimization`, and `sustainability`.
* Each pillar includes a set of `design principles`
and `best practices`.

## RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY

* Reliability measures how long a resource
performs its intended function.
* Availability measures the percentage of time
that a resource is in an operable state.
* High availability can be achieved in the AWS
Cloud by using the following:
  * Multiple servers
  * Isolated redundant data centers within
  each Availability Zone
  * Multiple Availability Zones within each
  Region
  * Multiple Regions around the world
  * Fault-tolerant services

## TRANSITION DATA CENTER TO THE CLOUD

* You can replace traditional on-premises data
center components with AWS services to
transition to the cloud and gain the benefits of
cloud computing.
* Use the principles and best practices that are
defined in the AWS Cloud Adoption
Framework (AWS CAF) and the AWS Well Architected Framework to guide your
transition to the cloud.

## WELL ARCHITECTED PRINCIPLES

The key design principles that are promoted in the
AWS Well-Architected Framework include the
following:

* Stop guessing your capacity needs.
* Test systems at production scale.
* Automate to make architectural
experimentation easier.
* Provide for evolution using data.
* Drive architectures using data.
* Improve through game days.
