### How to Choose Regions and Availability Zones

When deploying resources in Azure, it's crucial to consider factors such as:

- **Proximity to Users:** Choose a region that is geographically close to your users to minimize latency.

- **Compliance Requirements:** Ensure that the chosen region complies with regulatory and data residency requirements.

- **High Availability Needs:** If high availability is a priority, distribute resources across multiple Availability Zones within a region.

- **Disaster Recovery Planning:** Leverage region pairing for effective disaster recovery planning.
